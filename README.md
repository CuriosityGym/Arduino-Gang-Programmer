# Arduino-Gang-Programmer

This project came up as need to do programming of an Arduinos in a matter of minutes. 

Each arduino is expected to be of the same kind, and the same program is be put on the arduino. 

Please use a .hex file as an argument to the shell script, in addition to the path to avrdude and avrdude.conf


This is a work in progress, and is expected to run on a Linux environment with Python and avrdude installed. 

Windows environments are yet to be supported.
